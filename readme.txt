🕵️‍♂️ Ghost Logoff – Interactive Forensics Case

Ghost Logoff is an immersive, browser-based forensic science case designed and built as my final project for a high school Forensic Science course. Rather than turning in a static report or diorama, I wanted to create something more interactive — a digital case file that classmates (and anyone) could explore, investigate, and try to solve.
🎓 Why I Made This

As part of our second semester final, we were asked to create an original crime scenario, provide physical and digital evidence, and walk through how the case could be solved using forensic techniques we’d learned throughout the year. While many students chose models or presentations, I decided to build an interactive mystery website to showcase the process of solving a case — step-by-step, clue-by-clue.
🔍 Case Overview

A high school senior is found dead in the tech lab. The crime scene raises more questions than answers: missing footage, altered digital logs, and a suspicious hoodie fiber. You play the investigator. Analyze the evidence. Eliminate suspects. Figure out what really happened.
